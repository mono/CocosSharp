# CocosSharp v1.6.0.0 release notes 
## Key new features
 ---
### Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2015 support

With the release of Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 we have added support for Windows 8.1 CocosSharp projects.  Visual Studio 2015 no longer opens Windows 8.0 projects giving the opportunity to migrate to Windows 8.1.

### New project templates for Windows 8.1 that will load in Visual Studio 2015

Upgrade the templates to the latest release.

### Text Field input

A new class was added to support input for the supported platforms.  You can now use `CCTextField` to enable keyboard input.

To enable this you will create an instance of `CCTextField` and add it as a child to your Scene Graph.

                var textField = new CCTextField("[click here for input]",
                    "fonts/MarkerFelt",
                    22,
                    CCLabelFormat.SpriteFont);
    
                textField.Position = s.Center;
    
                textField.AutoEdit = true;
    
                AddChild(textField);
    

There are different delegates you can subscribe to be notified when specific actions have happened:

            textField.BeginEditing += OnBeginEditing;
            textField.EndEditing += OnEndEditing;

For instance to scroll the text field up the screen when editing begins and scroll it back into position when editing ends:

            public override void OnEnter()
            {
                base.OnEnter();
    
                // define our scrolling actions
                scrollUp = new CCMoveTo(0.5f, VisibleBoundsWorldspace.Top() - new CCPoint(0, s.Height / 4));
                scrollDown = new CCMoveTo(0.5f, textField.Position);
    
            }
    
            private void OnEndEditing(object sender, ref string text, ref bool canceled)
            {
                ((CCNode)sender).RunAction(scrollDown);
            }
    
            private void OnBeginEditing(object sender, ref string text, ref bool canceled)
            {
                ((CCNode)sender).RunAction(scrollUp);
            }

There are also delegates that can be subscribed to that will notify the developer of keyboard show and hide events:

            void AttachListeners()
            {
                // Attach our listeners.
                var imeImplementation = trackNode.TextFieldIMEImplementation;
                imeImplementation.KeyboardDidHide += OnKeyboardDidHide;
                imeImplementation.KeyboardDidShow += OnKeyboardDidShow;
                imeImplementation.KeyboardWillHide += OnKeyboardWillHide;
                imeImplementation.KeyboardWillShow += OnKeyboardWillShow;
    
            }

`CCTextField` Samples include:

[TextField](https://github.com/mono/cocos-sharp-samples/tree/master/TextField) in CocosSharp Samples
[TextFieldTest](https://github.com/mono/CocosSharp/tree/master/tests/tests/classes/tests/TextInputTest) in our tests.  

The tests also show an example of customizing how the text field works by implementing a [custom IMEImplementation](https://github.com/mono/CocosSharp/blob/master/tests/tests/classes/tests/TextInputTest/TextInputTest.cs#L556).



### CCStats Enhancements

There were a few problems with CocosSharp's statistics not working correctly across all platforms. New `CCStats` uses a new font with more characters, which allows us to display even short descriptions of the values.

### Windows Phone 8.1 `CCLabel`

CCLabel is now supported on Windows Phone 8.1.  There were multiple problems across devices were it did not work at all and are now fixed in this release.  

### Release Contributors

* Alex Sorokoletov - Fixed Windows Phone 8.1 orientation, also provided valuable feedback on Windows Phone 8.1 CCLabel support.
* Vincent Dondain - Upgrade of CocosSharp Xamarin Studio templates to use the new project wizard pages.



## Breaking changes
 ---

### Windows 8.0 is not longer delivered in our NuGet packages.

Due to the way NuGet packages it's support for netcore targets we can only provide one so Windows 8.0 support was replaced with Windows 8.1 assemblies.  For those relying on this support you can still compile from source and use the generated NuGets for Windows 8.0.

### Legacy support for iOS .xnb content assets generated by the pipeline.

Previously, MonoGame would try to load the generated .xnb even though it was not generated for iOS platform specifically.  Now you may have to rebuild these if they were not specifically targeting iOS platform.  We have seen this mostly with .spritefonts that are used.

So if you have a project that used to work with .xnb formatted assets and after upgrading there are loading problems try regenerating them  specifically targeting iOS platform.  

View the [CocosSharp Content Pipeline introduction](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/game_development/cocossharp/content_pipeline/)

### Unified PCL NuGet changes

*  iOS
*  Android
*  Windows DX
*  Windows 8.1
*  Windows Phone 8.1
*  Windows Phone 8.0

This also includes changes to the PCL profiles that are supported.  If you have problems updating your PCL projects you will need to update the profile to include Windows 8.1 or the NuGet package will not install.

Mac - .NETPortable Version=v4.5 Profile=Profile111
Windows - .NETPortable Version=v4.5 Profile=Profile138
